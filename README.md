# speedrun-marathon-in-a-box
Documentation, scripts, and other assorted tools to assist with spooling up a speedrun marathon, with a primary goal to reduce barrier to entry (and because my memory is atrocious)

This will also double as a way to document all the learning required; my (R30) personal background is in math and statistics, with IT related stuff as a hobby. As such, if anyone has ideas on how to improve things, feel free to suggest them.
